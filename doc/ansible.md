## Gpt mess

gpt what is ansible? can it be relevant to setting up my environment after having installed fedora linux minimall on a new computer?
Ansible is an open-source automation tool for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It uses YAML for its playbooks, making it easy to write and understand.

Here's a simple example of an Ansible playbook to install some common packages on Fedora:

```yaml
---
- name: Setup Fedora environment
  hosts: localhost
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Update all packages
      dnf:
        name: '*'
        state: latest
    - name: Install essential packages
      dnf:
        name:
          - vim
          - git
          - curl
          - wget
        state: present
```

To run this playbook, save it to a file (e.g., `setup.yml`) and execute:

```sh
ansible-playbook setup.yml
```

This will update all packages and install Vim, Git, Curl, and Wget. Adjust the playbook to fit your specific needs.

Yes, Ansible can be very relevant for setting up your environment after installing Fedora Linux minimal. You can automate the installation of packages, configuration of system settings, and setup of your development environment.

You can include Ansible playbooks in your dotfiles repo to automate the setup process. Here's a basic example:

1. Install Ansible:

   ```sh
   sudo dnf install ansible
   ```

2. Create a playbook (e.g., `setup.yml`):

   ```yaml
   ---
   - hosts: localhost
     become: yes
     tasks:
       - name: Install essential packages
         dnf:
           name:
             - git
             - vim
             - tmux
           state: present
       - name: Clone dotfiles repo
         git:
           repo: 'https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git'
           dest: /home/yourusername/dotfiles
           version: master

       - name: Create symlinks for dotfiles
         file:
           src: /home/yourusername/dotfiles/.vimrc
           dest: /home/yourusername/.vimrc
           state: link
   ```

3. Run the playbook:

   ```sh
   ansible-playbook setup.yml
   ```

Include the `setup.yml` in your dotfiles repo, and you can easily set up your environment on any new machine.
